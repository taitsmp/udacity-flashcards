# Flashcards

A simple native flashcards app that supports creating multiple flashcard decks.   

# Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:taitsmp/udacity-flashcards.git
cd flashcards
yarn install
```

# Running Flashcards

Ensure you are in the `flashcards` directory. 

```
yarn start
```

Open up the Expo App on your phone and scan the QR code.  The app should start immediately. 

# Troubleshooting

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
yarn start -- --reset-cache
```
